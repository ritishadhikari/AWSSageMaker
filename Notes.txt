Allows to bring togather Capabilities that allows to build highly accurate models that improves over time. 

Sagemaker lets you connect and load your data from sources such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift in just a few 
clicks from Sagemaker studio which can then be used to train your model.

Sagemaker Data Wrangler converts, transforms or combine raw tabular data into features into fraction of the time
it typically takes. 

We can save these features to Sagemaker feature store which lets you check in and check out features. The surface 
lets you create multiple versions of features and you can add descriptions and search for features, which can 
then later be used for other models. 

Sagemaker Clarify helps ensure that training data is well balanced, which means that the possible values for 
the features are well represented in the data and the accuracy of the trained models is roughly the same across
different subsets of the data such as different musical genres.  We can also use Sagemaker Clarify to inspect
individual predictions to understand how each feature plays a role in the prediction. 

To continually improve the model by rebuilding it regularly, we can take advantage of Sagemaker Pipelines which
provides continous integration and continous deployment capability. It helps to deliver better models more
quickly.
